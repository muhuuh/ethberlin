- Problem Statement: 

People who want to enter the Web3 ecosystem are often easily overwhelmed by the sheer volume of blogs, articles and bariers to entry. They simply need an easy accessible way to learn about Blockchain technology.
The objectives we address are to provide an easy-to-use application that provides a low entry level for people that have no knowledge about blockchain, Crypto, Web 3. We want to make this topic easy to access and do our part for a more balanced diversity. Our education app follows a playful approach, with easy to digest information.

- Remark:

The project consits of a font-end and a back-end that are not yet connected because of time issues.
